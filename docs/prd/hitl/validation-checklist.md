# Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Epic can be completed in 1-3 stories (plus one supporting control story) with bounded scope.
- [x] No architectural overhaul required; enhancement follows existing orchestrator patterns.
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable with additive changes.
- [x] Enhancement stays within brownfield constraints and existing stack.

**Risk Assessment:**
- [x] Risk to existing system kept low via feature flags and additive schemas.
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (disable HITL feature, revert UI/flag).
- [x] Testing approach covers both HITL and automated regression scenarios.
- [x] Team owns orchestrator, Nitro, and Vue surfaces; integration points well understood.

**Completeness Check:**
- [x] Epic goal is clear and measurable (operators can intervene mid-plan reliably).
- [x] Stories are sequenced and scoped for incremental delivery.
- [x] Success criteria map directly to acceptance and integration checks.
- [x] Dependencies identified (agents server, Nitro API, Vue client, database migrations).
