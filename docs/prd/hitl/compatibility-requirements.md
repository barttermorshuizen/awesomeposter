# Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (HITL additions are additive and feature flagged).
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (additive migrations only).
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (Vuetify dialog styling, status chips).
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (HITL processing avoids blocking other runs).
