# Discovery Scoring Reviewer Guide

This guide explains how reviewers should interpret scores generated by the Discovery Scoring Engine and what to do when items are suppressed.

## 1. Where Scores Appear
- **Discovery Brief Dashboard**: Each item shows a primary score (0â€“1) next to the title. Hovering reveals component percentages.
- **Item Detail Drawer**: Expands component breakdowns (`keyword`, `recency`, `sourceWeight`) and the applied threshold.
- **Activity Stream**: `discovery.score.complete` events surface when scores update; suppressed items emit a queue update notice.

## 2. Understanding the Breakdown
- **Keyword Match**: Measures how closely the item matches configured keywords. High values mean strong topical alignment.
- **Recency Decay**: Rewards fresh content; older items trend toward zero.
- **Source Weighting**: Reflects trust levels for feeds (RSS, YouTube, etc.). Higher weights indicate preferred sources.
- **Threshold**: Items scoring below the current client threshold are suppressed automatically.

> Tip: Component values use the same weights configured per client; check the rollout notes if numbers feel unexpected.

## 3. Suppressed Items
- Suppressed items leave the reviewer queue but remain accessible via the "Suppressed" filter for auditing.
- Each suppression includes metadata with the reason (below threshold, duplicate) and the original score breakdown.
- To reinstate an item, use the existing admin override workflow; the system resets status to `pending_scoring` and reruns the agent.

## 4. Reviewer Actions & Feedback
- **Flag for Calibration**: If an item you expect to see is suppressed or poorly scored, use the "Flag for calibration" action. Provide notes so data scientists can adjust weights.
- **Manual Promote**: Promoting an item overrides suppression and logs the action for future tuning.
- **Duplicate Review**: Suppressed duplicates link to the canonical item; review the primary record instead of reprocessing the duplicate.

## 5. Troubleshooting
| Symptom | What To Check | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scores look identical across items | Configuration may be using fallback defaults. | Notify platform; they will verify configuration service health. |
| Items vanish mid-review | They were likely suppressed after a scoring update. | Check the Suppressed filter; flag if the decision seems wrong. |
| Component breakdown missing | SSE stream disconnected. | Refresh dashboard; if persistent, open a support ticket. |

Keep this guide handy during the pilot rollout. For additional questions, reach out to the PM or platform owner listed in the onboarding runbook.
