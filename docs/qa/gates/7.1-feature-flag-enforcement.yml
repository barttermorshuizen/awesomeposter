    notes: 'Flag helpers default to disabled and raise FeatureFlagDisabledError before any discovery data flows (`server/utils/client-config/feature-flags.ts`).'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Redis + in-process caching invalidates immediately on toggle and otherwise expires within 2 minutes (`server/utils/client-config/feature-flags.ts:23`).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'SSE handler broadcasts feature_disabled events and downstream repos fail closed; component tests cover rollback paths (`server/api/events/discovery.get.ts`, `src/__tests__/ClientDiscoverySourcesPanel.spec.ts`).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Shared helpers consolidate flag logic, with regression coverage in unit/API tests (`server/utils/__tests__/feature-flags.spec.ts`, `tests/api/discovery/events-stream.spec.ts`).'
