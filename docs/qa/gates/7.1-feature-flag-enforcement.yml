  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'API, repositories, and agents server call requireDiscoveryFeatureEnabled before discovery operations, returning 403 with fail-closed caching.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Redis plus in-process caches invalidate on toggles and honour the 2-minute TTL with a 30s fail-safe fallback.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'SSE listeners terminate on feature_disabled events; cache invalidation keeps stale sessions from persisting.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Shared helpers centralize feature flag logic across runtimes with focused unit coverage.'
