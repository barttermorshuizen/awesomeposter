    status: PASS
    notes: 'DSL inputs still route through the shared parser/catalog; no new external IO or privilege changes.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Normalization continues to rely on existing JSON-Logic evaluation; DSL parsing cost mirrors existing DSL entry points.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Route rejection spec plus runtime evaluator specs assert success and failure paths for DSL-backed policies.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Two copies of `validateConditionInput` exist (package + server); duplication risks drift without shared export.'

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - 'Deduplicate `validateConditionInput` by exporting a single shared helper so server and package stay aligned.'
