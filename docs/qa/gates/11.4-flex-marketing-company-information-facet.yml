gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Facet metadata sets direction to input instead of bidirectional, diverging from the architecture reference and breaking contract compatibility guarantees.'

top_issues:
  - severity: high
    summary: '`company_information` facet metadata direction is `input`, but architecture reference mandates `bidirectional`, so downstream output-side validation will fail.'

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security-sensitive surfaces touched.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Facet catalog metadata change only; no runtime hot paths modified.'
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: 'Direction mismatch will cause contract compilers and registry validation to reject bidirectional usage expected by architecture.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Catalog and architecture documentation diverge, increasing drift risk.'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Update `company_information` facet metadata to use `direction: "bidirectional"` and add coverage asserting direction parity with architecture reference.'
