# 13. Decisions on Deferred Scope
- HITL history beyond the create-post popup is out of scope for this release.
- Operators will not be able to edit HITL request payloads before responding.
- Multi-operator collaboration (multiple responders per prompt) is not required.
- Surfacing HITL audit data to downstream analytics/reporting is deferred.
