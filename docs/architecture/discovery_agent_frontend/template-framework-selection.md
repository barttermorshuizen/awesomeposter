# Template & Framework Selection
AwesomePoster already ships a Vue 3 + Vite + Vuetify SPA. The discovery agent UI extends that single-page app, so no new starter template is introduced. All discovery surfaces (source configuration, dashboard, telemetry) live inside the existing workspace and follow current composition-API + Pinia conventions. This keeps bundle, tooling, eslint, and testing flows untouched.
