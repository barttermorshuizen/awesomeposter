# 2. Non-Goals
- Replace or refactor the current agents server until the flex variant reaches feature parity.
- Redesign the SPA/Nitro API beyond the new flex entry point and popup wiring.
- Introduce new specialist agents that are unrelated to marketing flows; focus first on orchestrator flexibility.
- Deliver comprehensive analytics dashboards; basic logging and metrics parity with the current server is sufficient for launch.
