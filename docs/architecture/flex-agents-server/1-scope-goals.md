# 1. Scope & Goals
- Deliver a runtime-adaptable orchestration service where clients submit natural-language objectives and exact JSON output contracts.
- Support planner-driven decomposition that uses an agent capability registry and real-time preferences rather than hard-coded workflows.
- Preserve human-in-the-loop (HITL) interrupts, rehydration, and streaming telemetry already trusted in the existing agents server.
- Provide a drop-in backend for the new “Create Post” popup while staying generically useful for future marketing and ops use cases.
- Allow new policy needs (for example “produce two variants”) to be satisfied at runtime without shipping server code or configuration changes.
