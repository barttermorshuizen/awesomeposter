# Story 5.3: Bulk Actions & Undo

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** reviewer,
**I want** to apply bulk status changes with an undo safety net,
**so that** I can manage high-volume nuggets efficiently without accidental mistakes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-select control enables selecting multiple briefs across current page; selection persists when filters change until cleared.
2. Bulk promote/archive actions require confirmation modal summarizing count and action.
3. After bulk action, snackbar provides 30-second undo; undo reverses status change and restores notes/history as before.
4. Conflicts (brief already promoted by another user) surface inline errors for affected items without blocking others.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement multi-select state management in list view (AC 1).
- [ ] Create bulk action API endpoints supporting batch operations with transactional safeguards (AC 2, AC 4).
- [ ] Add snackbar + undo queue logic on frontend, calling rollback endpoint (AC 3).
- [ ] Handle optimistic UI updates and reconcile conflicts with error toasts (AC 4).
- [ ] Write tests for bulk flows, including undo and conflict scenarios (AC 3, AC 4).

## Dev Notes
- Limit batch size (e.g., 50) to avoid long-running transactions; communicate if limit exceeded.
- Coordinate with telemetry to count bulk promotions separately.

### Testing
- Integration: simulate concurrent promotions to validate conflict handling.
- UI automation: Playwright test for bulk select + undo.
