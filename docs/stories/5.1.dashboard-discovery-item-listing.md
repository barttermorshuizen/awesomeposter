# Story 5.1: Discovery Item Listing & Filtering

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** reviewer,
**I want** to browse `Spotted` discovery items (nuggets) with rich filtering and search,
**so that** I can quickly find nuggets relevant to my campaign.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. List view supports filters for source, topic keyword, status, and date range; filters are combinable and reflected in query params.
2. Keyword search matches against title and extracted body (case-insensitive) with highlighting in results.
3. Pagination handles at least 1,000 discovery items with stable navigation (page size selectable: 25/50/100).
4. Default view shows last 48 hours of `Spotted` discovery items sorted by score descending.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build filter components and wire them to router query params (AC 1).
- [ ] Implement search backend endpoint with pagination and highlight metadata (AC 2, AC 3).
- [ ] Add default filter preset applied on initial load (AC 4).
- [ ] Ensure SSE events update the list incrementally (AC 4).
- [ ] Write UI tests verifying filter combinations and pagination state (AC 1, AC 3).

## Dev Notes
- Reuse existing Vue/Vuetify table patterns for consistency.
- Consider virtualization if performance lags beyond 1,000 items.

### Testing
- Frontend unit/integration tests for filter logic.
- API tests asserting search results order and pagination.
