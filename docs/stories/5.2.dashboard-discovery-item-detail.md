# Story 5.2: Discovery Item Detail & Promotion

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** reviewer,
**I want** to inspect an individual discovery item, leave notes, and promote it to an `Approved` brief,
**so that** downstream agents can act on curated nuggets.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Detail view displays metadata: title, source, score breakdown, extracted body, duplicate references, timestamps.
2. Promotion action requires note entry (min 5 characters) and records actor + timestamp in history.
3. Status history shows chronological log of changes with notes; visible without page reload.
4. Promotion triggers SSE `brief.promoted` and persists status change even if SSE consumer disconnects.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement detail drawer/page using existing layout components (AC 1).
- [ ] Add note input with validation and submission to backend (AC 2).
- [ ] Update backend to persist status history entry with note + actor (AC 2, AC 3).
- [ ] Emit SSE event and update list state optimistically with rollback if failure (AC 4).
- [ ] Write tests covering required note, SSE emission, and history rendering (AC 2, AC 3).

## Dev Notes
- Use ASCII constraint for notes; sanitize to prevent HTML injection.
- Consider hooking into telemetry counts for promotions (Telemetry epic).

### Testing
- Frontend: component tests ensuring note required, history updates.
- API: verify status change persists and returns updated history payload.
