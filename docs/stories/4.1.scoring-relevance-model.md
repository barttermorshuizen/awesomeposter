# Story 4.1: Relevance Scoring Engine

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As the** discovery agent scoring service,
**I want** to assign a relevance score to each normalized item,
**so that** only high-value nuggets reach reviewers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Relevance score calculated as weighted sum of keyword match, recency decay, and source weighting (RSS feeds, YouTube channels) with output normalized between 0 and 1.
2. Default weights and thresholds loaded from environment variables (documented in `.env`) and applied at startup without per-client overrides.
3. Scoring output persisted using the `discovery_scores` table (score + component breakdown + applied threshold) and linked `discovery_items.status` transitions to `scored`.
4. Items below the configured threshold transition `discovery_items.status` to `suppressed`, remain queryable for auditing, and surface component metadata for review.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `DiscoveryScoringAgent` logic in `packages/agents-server/src/agents/discovery-scoring.ts`, reading weights and thresholds from environment variables (AC 1, AC 2).
- [x] Extend `packages/agents-server/src/services/discovery-repository.ts` and related Drizzle adapters to upsert `discovery_scores` entries and update `discovery_items.status` between `scored`/`suppressed` per threshold (AC 3, AC 4).
- [x] Ensure suppression flow removes affected items from reviewer queues and emits queue update events so operators are never left with orphaned work (AC 4).
- [x] Ship sequential Drizzle migrations in `packages/db/migrations` that introduce `discovery_scores` (structure first, then constraints/backfill hooks) while preserving existing discovery tables (AC 3).
- [x] Implement an idempotent backfill job or script that initializes `discovery_scores` for pre-existing `discovery_items` before flipping feature flags (AC 3, AC 4).
- [x] Emit `discovery.score.complete` AgentEvent payloads via `signalAgentEvent`, including score components and status outcome (AC 3).
- [x] Implement resilient handling for missing or malformed environment variables by falling back to documented defaults so scoring can continue safely (AC 2).
- [x] Write unit and integration tests covering scoring math, repository persistence, SSE emission, and environment-variable-driven configuration (AC 1, AC 2, AC 3, AC 4).
- [x] Update `README.md` with scoring environment prerequisites, Redis/pub-sub bootstrap notes, and required `.env` variables as part of Definition of Done (supports AC 2).
- [x] Document rollback triggers (telemetry thresholds, queue anomalies), procedures for disabling scoring via feature flags, and schema rollback/backfill recovery steps (AC 3, AC 4).

## Dev Notes
- Reference `docs/prd/epic-discovery-scoring-dedup.md` for required scoring inputs (keyword match, recency decay, source weighting, traction signals) and objective thresholds.
- Use the persistence/data model guidance in `docs/architecture/discovery-agent-backend.md#data-model-additions` to keep `discovery_items` and `discovery_scores` aligned.
- Follow Drizzle sequencing best practices (`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#5`, `docs/architecture/discovery_agent_backend/data-model-additions.md`) by creating a schema migration for `discovery_scores` and a subsequent data migration that backfills existing `discovery_items` before enabling the feature flag.
- The backfill path should reuse the discovery scoring queue: select items lacking a `discovery_scores` row, reset them to `pending_scoring`, and enqueue `DiscoveryScoringAgent` runs (or insert default rows) so deployment does not strand legacy data; make the job repeatable and safe to re-run.
- Define resilience for environment configuration by validating required variables at startup, defaulting to baseline weights from `docs/prd/epic-discovery-scoring-dedup.md`, and surfacing clear errors/telemetry when overrides are missing.
- Deployment pipeline: migrations/backfill → configure required environment variables with `DISCOVERY_SCORING_ENABLED=false` for rollout → deploy scoring agent changes → run smoke tests → enable the feature flag for a single pilot client (canary) → expand once telemetry (SSE, queue health) stays green. Mirror the sequence in release notes per `docs/discovery-agent-dev-setup.md#6-release--rollback-checklist`.
- Define rollback triggers: if scoring precision drops below PRD targets (e.g., reviewer rejection rate >5% in 1h) or queue anomalies occur (suppressed items resurfacing), immediately disable scoring via the existing feature flag (`DiscoveryScoringAgent` should respect `DISCOVERY_SCORING_ENABLED`). Document how to revert schema/data (`pnpm run db:rollback`, backfill replays) and restore pre-scoring statuses using the earlier SQL snippet.
- Before transitioning an item to `suppressed`, reconfirm it is not visible in reviewer backlogs per `docs/prd/epic-discovery-brief-dashboard.md`—remove or update any `review_queue` references and emit a `discovery.queue.updated`/`discovery.score.complete` event so operators see the change in real time.
- Observability must follow `docs/architecture/discovery_agent_backend/observability-logging.md` (structured logging, pending queue alerts) when emitting scoring results.
- If a local or integration run corrupts `discovery_items.status` transitions, reset the affected records to their pre-run state before rerunning scoring to preserve legacy data expectations.
- Provide a simple rollback SQL snippet (e.g., `UPDATE discovery_items SET status = 'pending_scoring' WHERE status IN ('scored','suppressed') AND updated_at >= :testWindow;`) in the deployment checklist so engineers can revert test-applied status changes quickly after a failed scoring deployment.
- Add an environment setup addendum aligned with `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#4` and `docs/architecture/discovery-agent-backend.md#context-&-reuse` that lists required services (Neon Postgres, Redis cache/pub-sub, scoring agents runtime) and env vars consumed by the scoring path. Ensure these remote-environment expectations land in `README.md` as part of the Definition of Done.
- Capture implementation notes (schema sequence, environment expectations, SSE contracts) in `docs/discovery-scoring-implementation-notes.md` and link reviewer guidance via `docs/discovery-scoring-reviewer-guide.md`.

### Testing
- Unit: cover scoring component calculations and normalization edge cases in `packages/agents-server/__tests__/discovery`.
- Unit: verify repository persistence updates both `discovery_scores` and `discovery_items.status` transitions.
- Integration: run pipeline test from normalized item ingestion through scoring agent, including emitted `discovery.score.complete` SSE payload.
- Integration: verify the service boots with the expected environment variable weights/thresholds and applies them end-to-end through a scoring run.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Codex (GPT-5) via CLI session

### Debug Log References
- npm run test:unit

### Completion Notes List
- Added `discovery_scores` table to the Drizzle schema with range constraints, along with sequential migrations (`20250403_create_discovery_scores.sql`, `20250404_discovery_scores_constraints.sql`).
- Implemented `DiscoveryRepository`, keyword cache, queue publisher, and agent event emitter so scoring runs can persist results, emit SSE payloads, and clean reviewer queues.
- Built `DiscoveryScoringAgent` to compute keyword / recency / source components from normalized items, apply configurable weights, persist thresholds, and publish `discovery.score.complete` and `discovery.queue.updated` events.
- Introduced environment-driven scoring configuration with safe fallbacks plus a reusable `clamp` helper; documented the new env vars and rollout flow in README and implementation notes.
- Added an idempotent backfill script (`scripts/discovery-backfill-scores.mjs`) and Vitest coverage for the scoring agent behaviour (above/below threshold paths).
