# Story 7.1: Feature Flag Enforcement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As the** platform,
**I want** discovery services to honor client-level feature flags,
**so that** only approved pilots use the discovery agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend services (ingestion, scoring, dashboard APIs) check feature flag before processing client data and short-circuit when disabled.
2. Disabled clients receive clear messaging in UI explaining discovery agent is not enabled.
3. Default state for new clients is disabled; enabling requires explicit flag toggle.
4. Flag state cached for performance but refreshed within 2 minutes of change.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Integrate with existing feature flag provider or implement new table keyed by client (AC 1, AC 3).
- [ ] Add middleware/guards to backend services to enforce flag (AC 1).
- [ ] Update frontend routes to hide dashboard and display disabled banner (AC 2).
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategy and tests to ensure refresh within SLA (AC 4).
- [ ] Document enforcement behavior and default state (AC 3).

## Dev Notes
- Fail safe: if flag lookup errors, treat as disabled.
- Ensure telemetry does not record data for disabled clients.

### Testing
- Unit tests for middleware guard logic.
- End-to-end test toggling flag and verifying UI/ingestion behavior.
