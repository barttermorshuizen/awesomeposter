# Story 6.2: Discovery Counts Reporting

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** marketing lead,
**I want** at-a-glance counts of source hits, nuggets considered, and promotions,
**so that** I can gauge discovery agent activity without leaving the app.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Reporting view shows daily and weekly totals for source hits, nuggets considered, and promotions with date picker (default last 7 days).
2. Counts update live when SSE events arrive; manual refresh available.
3. Users can export the current view to CSV containing date, metric, count columns.
4. Metrics respect client scoping and only include data for enabled discovery agent clients.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build backend aggregation endpoint querying telemetry store (AC 1, AC 4).
- [ ] Create Vue reporting widget/cards with charts or tabular counts (AC 1).
- [ ] Wire SSE events to increment counters in real time (AC 2).
- [ ] Implement CSV export with ASCII-safe headers (AC 3).
- [ ] Add tests for aggregation accuracy and export formatting (AC 1, AC 3).

## Dev Notes
- Keep UI lightweight; use existing design system components.
- Consider caching aggregated results for performance.

### Testing
- Unit tests on telemetry aggregation functions.
- Frontend snapshot/interaction tests for date picker and export.
