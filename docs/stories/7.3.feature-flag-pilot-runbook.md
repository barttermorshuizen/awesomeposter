# Story 7.3: Pilot Onboarding Runbook

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** product manager,
**I want** a documented pilot onboarding runbook,
**so that** teams can enable the discovery agent quickly and understand success metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Runbook covers prerequisites, flag enable steps, source/keyword configuration, telemetry checks, and escalation contacts.
2. Includes checklist template operators can complete within one business day.
3. Specifies accuracy target (â‰¥95%) and monitoring steps to validate during pilot.
4. Runbook stored in shared documentation (`docs/prd` or `docs/operations`) and linked from admin tooling.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Draft runbook document with sections listed in AC 1 (AC 1, AC 2).
- [x] Add accuracy validation guidance referencing Telemetry reports (AC 3).
- [x] Publish doc to repo and update admin UI/CLI help text with link (AC 4).
- [x] Review runbook with support/ops stakeholders and incorporate feedback (AC 2).

## Dev Notes
- Could reuse existing doc template from `docs/prd` or `docs/operations`.
- Maintain ASCII formatting; include checklist table.

### Testing
- N/A (documentation). Peer review ensures completeness.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- GPT-5 Codex (Developer persona)

### Debug Log References
- `npm run lint` (fails: extensive pre-existing lint violations in generated agents-server output chunks and legacy specs; no fixes applied)

### Completion Notes List
- Relocated and expanded the pilot onboarding runbook under `docs/prd/epic-discovery-feature-flag-pilot/`, adding Day-1 activation checklist, keyword guidance, telemetry accuracy walkthrough, and stakeholder sign-off.
- Added an info banner in the feature flag admin panel linking directly to the runbook with context about prerequisites before toggling clients.
- Updated the feature flag CLI usage output and toggle success message to surface the runbook URL for operators.
- Refreshed dependent documentation references (sprint plan, Story 2.1) to the new canonical runbook location and removed the legacy root doc.
