# Story 7.3: Pilot Onboarding Runbook

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** product manager,
**I want** a documented pilot onboarding runbook,
**so that** teams can enable the discovery agent quickly and understand success metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Runbook covers prerequisites, flag enable steps, source/keyword configuration, telemetry checks, and escalation contacts.
2. Includes checklist template operators can complete within one business day.
3. Specifies accuracy target (â‰¥95%) and monitoring steps to validate during pilot.
4. Runbook stored in shared documentation (`docs/prd` or `docs/operations`) and linked from admin tooling.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Publish doc to repo and update admin UI/CLI help text with link (AC 4).
- [ ] Review runbook with support/ops stakeholders and incorporate feedback (AC 2).
