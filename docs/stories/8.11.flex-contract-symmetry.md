# Story 8.11: Symmetric Capability Contracts

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** flex orchestrator engineer,  
**I want** capability registrations to expose both `inputContract` and `outputContract` fields,  
**so that** input and output schemas are treated symmetrically and downstream consumers no longer rely on `metadata.inputSchema`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `CapabilityRegistrationSchema` in `@awesomeposter/shared` defines `inputContract` and `outputContract` fields while deprecating `defaultContract`.
2. The flex agents server persists both contract fields in the `flex_capabilities` table and migrates existing data without loss.
3. Registry routes, services, and agent self-registration all read/write the new contract fields and remain backward compatible for existing records.
4. Documentation references the new contract fields instead of `defaultContract` / `metadata.inputSchema`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Update shared Zod schema and types for `CapabilityRegistration` to include `inputContract` / `outputContract` and alias `defaultContract` for backward compatibility. (AC 1, AC 3)
- [ ] Extend Drizzle schema/migration in `packages/db` so `flex_capabilities` stores both contract blobs (with data backfill). (AC 2)
- [ ] Refactor flex registry service, Nitro route, and agent modules to use the new fields. (AC 3)
- [ ] Add tests covering registration payload validation, persistence round-trips, and legacy data upgrade path. (AC 1, AC 2)
- [ ] Update architecture docs, README guidance, and story notes to reflect the symmetric contracts. (AC 4)

## Story Context
- Dependent on current capability registration flow introduced in Story 8.7 where agents self-register metadata.
- Impacts shared package (`@awesomeposter/shared`), flex registry service, and database schema.

## References
- Story 8.7 capability inventory and registration flow (`docs/stories/8.7.flex-capability-inventory.md`) for current metadata shape and bootstrap pattern to extend.
- Architecture guide, capability contracts section (`docs/architecture/flex-agents-server.md#11-capability-registry--agent-contracts`) and current inventory table (`docs/architecture/flex-agents-server.md#current-inventory`) to update once the symmetric fields land.
- README flex agents streaming overview (`README.md#flex-agents-streaming-api`) to align public guidance and environment setup with the new contract fields.

## Acceptance Criteria (Detailed)
1. Shared contract types expose `inputContract` / `outputContract` with parity to existing `CapabilityRegistration` capabilities and preserve compatibility for consumers expecting `defaultContract`.
2. Database migration safely adds new columns (or renames existing) and backfills from `defaultContractJson` / `metadata` for current rows.
3. Registry service can read legacy records (with only `defaultContract`) and return the new structure without breaking clients.
4. Documentation and examples reference `inputContract` / `outputContract`, and no internal code path depends on `metadata.inputSchema`.

## Technical Notes
- Consider using a helper to map existing records (`defaultContract` + `metadata.inputSchema`) into the new structure until migration completes.
- Coordinate the shared package release so all consumers upgrade together (flex server, registry tests, Nitro endpoint).
- Migration should be additive where possible; if renaming columns, ensure downtime is avoided (deploy migration first, then code).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Schema updates merged in `@awesomeposter/shared`.
- [ ] Database migration applied and verified locally.
- [ ] Flex server agents self-register with `inputContract` / `outputContract`.
- [ ] Tests updated/passing across shared package and flex server.
- [ ] Documentation updated (architecture + README).

## Risk and Compatibility Check
- **Risk:** Shared schema change could break downstream services if not coordinated.  
  **Mitigation:** Use a two-step rollout with compatibility aliases and document upgrade path.
- **Risk:** Existing registry records missing `inputContract` until migration completes.  
  **Mitigation:** Provide fallback mapping during transition.

**Compatibility Verification**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs once compatibility layer is in place.
- [ ] Database changes are additive or include safe data migration.
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns (documentation only).
- [x] Performance impact is negligible.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session.
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward.
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly.
- [ ] No design or architecture work required.
- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous.
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified.
- [x] Success criteria are testable.
- [x] Rollback approach is simple.

## Success Criteria
1. Capability registrations expose both input/output contracts and no longer rely on `metadata.inputSchema`.
2. Registry persistence and APIs serve the new fields without regressions.
3. Documentation and tests describe the symmetric contract model.

## Important Notes
- Coordinate the shared package release version and update dependents in lockstep.
- Communicate migration steps to teams consuming capability snapshots.
